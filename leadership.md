## Formal Training
### Singapore Armed Forces; Officer Cadet School (OCS) 
Singapore conscripts all men to serve for 2 years in the Armed Forces. After Basic Military Training, I was selected to undergo intensive full-time leadership training at SAFTI MI, Singapore. There, I successfully completed the CLM and Service Terms, gaining the foundations and experiences required for good leadership and teamwork.

## Medical School Projects
### Basics of the ECG iBook Publication
As part of a student-selected component, I led a dedicated team to design, illustrate, vet, and publish an interactive iBook titled "Basics of the ECG." This resource, which has been downloaded over 5000 times on the [Apple iBooks Store](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/basics-of-the-ecg/id1118593363), remains a useful tool for medical students and young doctors to understand ECGs.

### Enabling Twice Daily Consultant-Led Ward Rounds in a Medical High Dependency Unit

In another student-selected component, I led an initiative to ensure compliance with the mandated twice-daily consultant ward rounds. By redesigning the daily ward round sheet and collaborating with hospital officials, we integrated our form into the hospital's system, ensuring sustainable change and improved patient care. This work later attracted the Kevin Murphy Prize for Enhancing Patient Safety through Quality Improvement. This annual prize is given to the best quality improvement project throughout NHS Tayside.

## Data Science Roles

#### Data Scientist for Norwich Cardiology Research Group
As a data scientist for the Cardiology Research Group under *Professor Vassiliou S. Vassilios*, I play a crucial role in planning statistical analyses and designing machine learning models for deployment. This position allows me to contribute significantly to advancing cardiology research through applied data science.

#### REDCap Systems Administrator
I led the procurement and deployment of resources to host REDCap for the Norwich Cardiology Research Group. Being able to manage such a platform requires significant data engineering skills. I utilised Amazon Cloud Services to establish a robust platform for the research team.

## BMA Leadership Roles
#### Journey to National Leadership

My journey in leadership began with my election to the North of Scotland Local Negotiating Committee for Junior Doctors (LNCJDS) in 2021. During my tenure, I collaborated with staff to address discrepancies in work schedules and pay, achieving a 50% pay uplift for doctors in a particular rotation. This experience honed my skills in negotiation and advocacy, preparing me for more significant challenges ahead.

#### Organising for Change with DoctorsVote

Doctors pay was worsening year by year. Only a national co-ordinated effort could bring about the change we needed. I sought out and joined a grassroots organisation called DoctorsVote. A group focussed on full pay restoraton. Here, we laid down the groundwork required to bring this issue to the minds of doctors. I designed several infographics that played a significant role in bringing the issue to the forefront. Once the issue was sufficiently exposed, we made our collective bid for the BMA National Seats. DoctorsVote candidates managed to secure all but one seat at the National Assembly.

#### Creating a Novel Calculator with Python
I realised that doctor's pay is extremely complex. Within DoctorsVote, I saw an opportunity to lead a team of technically skilled doctors to develop a much needed [pay calculator](https://pay.doctorsvote.app/). It was developed and rigourously tested over months. It is currently in use nationally and remains to be the gold standard for Junior Doctor pay verification.

#### National Leadership and Advocacy
Today, I am privileged to serve on the BMA UK Junior Doctors Committee (UKJDC) and several other subcommittees, including the Joint Academic Trainees Subcommittee. It is an honor to have the opportunity to influence policies that impact every junior doctor in England. Beyond addressing the ongoing pay dispute, we have spearheaded significant work in defining the scope for physician associates. Furthermore, our committee was the first to propose transitioning from the term "Junior Doctor" to "Resident Doctor."
