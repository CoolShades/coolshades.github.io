#### Transition Training for Medical Students
I have conducted ten sessions for first-year and third-year medical students at the University of Dundee. These sessions were designed to equip students with the essential skills required to transition smoothly into clinical medicine. The training focused on practical skills, clinical reasoning, and effective communication, providing a strong foundation for their future medical careers.

#### Student Selected Component (SSC) Module Design
Working closely with local tutors at the University of Dundee Medical School, I developed a unique Student Selected Component (SSC) module for first-year medical students titled "A Deep Dive into Hypertension: Understanding the Evidence Base Behind Current National Guidelines." This module ran from November 2, 2020, to March 26, 2021, and involved in-depth teaching and supervision of students over five months. The module focused on critical analysis of hypertension guidelines, fostering evidence-based thinking and practical application among students.

#### Multi-Regional Programme: The Keys to FY1
Collaborating with colleagues and local tutors, I designed and organized a multi-regional program called "The Keys to FY1." This program was rolled out to new Foundation Doctors across NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside over three months in 2021. The program aimed to prepare newly graduated doctors for their first year of foundation training, covering essential clinical skills, patient safety, and professional development.

#### Basics of the ECG iBook Publication
To enhance the learning experience of medical students, I led a team to design, illustrate, and publish an interactive iBook titled "Basics of the ECG" as part of a student-selected component. This resource has been downloaded over 5000 times on the [Apple iBooks Store](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/basics-of-the-ecg/id1118593363) and serves as a valuable educational tool. The project involved creating engaging content that simplifies complex ECG concepts, making it more accessible for learners. This initiative not only improved my teaching skills but also contributed significantly to medical education internationally by providing a widely used learning resource.

#### Portfolio Supervision
As a portfolio supervisor, I have guided first, second, and third-year medical students in managing and developing their portfolios. This role involves providing regular feedback, mentoring, and support to help students reflect on their learning experiences, set goals, and achieve academic and professional milestones.
