## From Concept to Reality: The Journey of Creating the FPR Modeller

In the world of healthcare and medical professionals, understanding the intricacies of pay progression and restoration is crucial. This need inspired me to develop the Full Pay Restoration (FPR) Modeller, a sophisticated web application designed to help medical professionals, union representatives, and policymakers visualize and analyze complex pay scenarios. In this post, I'll take you through the development process, highlight key features, and share insights into the technology that powers this tool.

### The Spark: Why Build an FPR Modeller?

The idea for the FPR Modeller stemmed from the ongoing discussions about pay restoration in the medical field. I realized there was a need for a tool that could:

1. Visualize pay progression over time
2. Calculate the impact of inflation on real pay
3. Track progress towards full pay restoration
4. Estimate the costs associated with different pay deals

With these goals in mind, I set out to create a user-friendly, data-driven application that could handle these complex calculations and present the results in an easily digestible format.

### Choosing the Right Tools

After considering various options, I decided to build the FPR Modeller using:

- **Python**: For its robust data processing capabilities and extensive libraries
- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework for creating web applications with Python
- **Plotly**: For interactive and visually appealing charts
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis

These tools allowed me to rapidly develop a prototype and iterate on the design based on user feedback.

### Key Features of the FPR Modeller

Let's dive into some of the core features I implemented in the app:

#### 1. Flexible Input Parameters

Users can adjust various parameters, including:

- Inflation measure (RPI or CPI)
- FPR calculation period
- Number of years in the pay deal
- Doctor counts at each nodal point
- Year-by-year pay rises and inflation projections

This flexibility allows for a wide range of scenarios to be modeled and compared.

Here's a glimpse into how the sidebar inputs are set up using Streamlit:

```python
def setup_sidebar():
    initialize_session_state()
    
    st.sidebar.title("Modeller Settings ‚öôÔ∏è")
    
    st.sidebar.subheader("Calculate Pay Restoration Targets.")
    
    inflation_type = st.sidebar.radio("Select inflation measure:", ("RPI", "CPI"), key="inflation_type", on_change=update_fpr_targets, horizontal=True)
    
    col1, col2 = st.sidebar.columns(2)
    with col1:
        fpr_start_year = st.selectbox(
            "FPR start year",
            options=AVAILABLE_YEARS,
            index=AVAILABLE_YEARS.index(st.session_state.fpr_start_year),
            key="fpr_start_year",
            on_change=update_end_year_options
        )
    with col2:
        fpr_end_year = st.selectbox(
            "FPR end year",
            options=st.session_state.end_year_options,
            index=st.session_state.end_year_options.index(st.session_state.fpr_end_year),
            key="fpr_end_year",
            on_change=update_fpr_targets
        )
    
    # ... [rest of the function]

    return inflation_type, fpr_start_year, fpr_end_year, num_years, st.session_state.fpr_targets, st.session_state.doctor_counts, year_inputs, additional_hours, out_of_hours
```

This function sets up the sidebar inputs and manages the state of the application, allowing for dynamic updates based on user interactions.

#### 2. Interactive Visualizations

One of the most powerful aspects of the FPR Modeller is its ability to visually represent complex data. I implemented several interactive charts using Plotly:

- Pay Progression Chart: Shows baseline pay, pay increases, FPR progress, and pay erosion over time
- Pay Increase Curve: Displays nominal increases, real increases, and cumulative costs

These visualizations help users quickly grasp the long-term implications of different pay scenarios.

The creation of interactive visualizations is powered by Plotly. Here's an example of how the pay progression chart is created:

```python
def create_pay_progression_chart(result, num_years):
    years = [f"Year {i} ({2023+i}/{2024+i})" for i in range(num_years + 1)]
    nominal_pay = result["Pay Progression Nominal"]
    baseline_pay = result["Base Pay"]
    pay_increase = [max(0, pay - baseline_pay) for pay in nominal_pay]
    percent_increase = [(increase / baseline_pay) * 100 for increase in pay_increase]
    pay_erosion = [-(x) * 100 for x in result["Real Terms Pay Cuts"]]
    fpr_progress = result["FPR Progress"]

    fig = make_subplots(specs=[[{"secondary_y": True}]])

    fig.add_trace(
        go.Bar(x=years, y=[baseline_pay] * len(years), name="Baseline Pay", marker_color='rgb(0, 123, 255)'),
        secondary_y=False,
    )

    fig.add_trace(
        go.Bar(x=years, y=pay_increase, name="Pay Increase", marker_color='rgb(255, 165, 0)',
               hovertemplate='Year: %{x}<br>Total Pay: ¬£%{customdata[0]:,.2f}<br>Increase: ¬£%{y:,.2f} (%{customdata[1]:.2f}%)<extra></extra>',
               customdata=list(zip(nominal_pay, percent_increase))),
        secondary_y=False,
    )

    fig.add_trace(
        go.Scatter(x=years, y=fpr_progress, name="FPR Progress", line=dict(color='rgb(0, 200, 0)', width=2)),
        secondary_y=True,
    )

    fig.add_trace(
        go.Scatter(x=years, y=pay_erosion, name="Pay Erosion", line=dict(color='rgb(255, 0, 0)', width=2)),
        secondary_y=True,
    )

    # ... [layout configuration]

    return fig
```

This function demonstrates how multiple data series are combined into a single, informative chart using Plotly's `make_subplots` and various trace types.

#### 3. Detailed Cost Breakdown

Understanding the financial impact of pay deals is crucial. The app provides a comprehensive cost breakdown, including:

- Basic pay costs
- Pension contributions
- Additional hours and out-of-hours costs
- Employer National Insurance contributions
- Tax recouped

This level of detail allows for more informed decision-making in pay negotiations.

The cost breakdown calculations involve several components. Here's a snippet showing how the costs are calculated:

```python
def calculate_costs(pay_progression_nominal, doctor_count, year_inputs, name, post_ddrb_pay, additional_hours, out_of_hours):
    yearly_basic_costs = []
    yearly_total_costs = []
    yearly_tax_recouped = []
    yearly_net_costs = []
    yearly_employer_ni_costs = []
    yearly_pension_costs = []

    def calculate_total_pay(basic_pay):
        additional_pay = (basic_pay / 40) * additional_hours
        ooh_pay = (basic_pay / 40) * out_of_hours * 0.37
        return basic_pay, additional_pay, ooh_pay

    def calculate_tax(total_pay, basic_pay):
        pension_contribution = calculate_pension_contribution(basic_pay)
        taxable_pay = total_pay - pension_contribution
        income_tax = calculate_income_tax(taxable_pay)
        ni = calculate_national_insurance(taxable_pay)
        return income_tax, ni, pension_contribution

    for year, (current_pay, prev_pay) in enumerate(zip(pay_progression_nominal[1:], pay_progression_nominal)):
        current_basic, current_additional, current_ooh = calculate_total_pay(current_pay)
        current_total_pay = current_basic + current_additional + current_ooh
        current_income_tax, current_ni, current_pension = calculate_tax(current_total_pay, current_basic)

        # ... [cost calculations for each year]

        yearly_basic_costs.append(basic_pay_cost)
        yearly_total_costs.append(total_cost)
        yearly_tax_recouped.append(tax_recouped)
        yearly_net_costs.append(net_cost)
        yearly_employer_ni_costs.append(employer_ni_cost)
        yearly_pension_costs.append(pension_cost)

    return yearly_basic_costs, yearly_total_costs, yearly_tax_recouped, yearly_net_costs, yearly_employer_ni_costs, yearly_pension_costs
```

This function showcases how various components of pay and taxation are factored into the cost calculations, providing a comprehensive breakdown of the financial implications of pay deals.

#### 4. FPR Achievement Tracking

The app calculates and displays whether the proposed pay deal achieves full pay restoration for each nodal point. This feature helps users quickly assess the effectiveness of different scenarios in meeting FPR targets.

The FPR achievement is calculated and displayed using the following function:

```python
def display_fpr_achievement(results):
    st.subheader(":blue-background[üëà Will FPR be achieved from this pay deal? üïµÔ∏è]")
    fpr_achieved = all(result["FPR Progress"][-1] >= 100 for result in results)
    
    if fpr_achieved:
        st.success("Yes, FPR will be achieved for all nodal points.")
    else:
        st.error("No, FPR will not be achieved for all nodal points. But some progress has been made...  \nNote the residual pay erosion figures in % below.")
    
    cols = st.columns(len(results))
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        with cols[i]:
            fpr_progress = result["FPR Progress"][-1]
            pay_erosion = result["Real Terms Pay Cuts"][-1]
            
            pay_erosion_formatted = f"{pay_erosion * 100:.2f}%"
            fpr_progress_formatted = f"FPR: {fpr_progress:.2f}%"
            
            st.metric(
                label=f"{result['Nodal Point']}",
                value=pay_erosion_formatted,
                delta=fpr_progress_formatted,
                delta_color="normal"
            )
```

This function not only determines whether FPR is achieved but also presents the results in an easy-to-understand format using Streamlit's `metric` component.

### The Heart of the Calculations: FPR and Pay Erosion

At the core of the FPR Modeller are the calculations for Full Pay Restoration progress and pay erosion. Let's take a closer look at how these are implemented:

```python
def calculate_real_terms_change(pay_rise, inflation):
    return ((1 + pay_rise) / (1 + inflation)) - 1

def calculate_new_pay_erosion(current_erosion, real_terms_change):
    return ((1 + current_erosion) * (1 + real_terms_change)) - 1

def calculate_fpr_and_erosion(base_pay, pay_progression_nominal, pay_progression_real, fpr_percentage, year_inputs):
    real_terms_pay_cuts = [-fpr_percentage / 100]
    fpr_progress = [0]

    for year, (nominal_pay, real_pay, year_input) in enumerate(zip(pay_progression_nominal[1:], pay_progression_real[1:], year_inputs)):
        total_pay_rise = (nominal_pay - pay_progression_nominal[year]) / pay_progression_nominal[year]
        inflation_rate = year_input["inflation"]
        
        real_terms_change = calculate_real_terms_change(total_pay_rise, inflation_rate)
        current_pay_cut = calculate_new_pay_erosion(real_terms_pay_cuts[-1], real_terms_change)
        
        real_terms_pay_cuts.append(current_pay_cut)
        current_progress = (fpr_percentage / 100 + current_pay_cut) / (fpr_percentage / 100) * 100
        fpr_progress.append(current_progress)

    return real_terms_pay_cuts[1:], fpr_progress[1:]
```

These functions demonstrate how the app calculates real terms changes in pay, tracks pay erosion over time, and measures progress towards the FPR target.
